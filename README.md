# Game-Dev-Notes
Collection of my notes on game development for different things.

These notes are present as is, and aren't meant to cover things like good design practices or the best methods to do things.

These are just notes for myself when creating video games.

Feel free to use these notes as you want. I chose not to use a license for this repo since no code is intended to be here.

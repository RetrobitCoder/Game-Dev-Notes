# Arduboy Notes
----
Notes are ranked in the order that I think is most important to remember with 1 being the most important


1. It seems to be best not to create a bunch of objects, but instead re-use objects to save memory. Example: created enemy object for level 1, 
on level 2 re-use same object and just update what needs to be updated for level 2
2. Most of the methods in the Arduboy2 library are static and don't need to create an instace of Arduboy to use them
